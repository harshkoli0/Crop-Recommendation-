# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning project that helps farmers and researchers identify the **best crop to grow** based on environmental and soil factors.  
It uses data-driven insights to recommend crops that will yield the highest productivity under given soil and weather conditions.

## 🎯 Objective
To predict the **most suitable crop** based on the following parameters:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH level of soil
- Rainfall (mm)
- Yield (hg/ha_yield)

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Normalize data  
   - Encode crop labels  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Split data into train/test sets  
   - Train model (Random Forest Classifier recommended)  
   - Evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Check model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
